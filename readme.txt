commands to put this file in Git with verison control
git add readme.txt (add the file)
git add -u (tracking)
or got add -A to do both in the same time 
and 
git commit -m "second commit on readme.txt" 
git push (to push the file on github)

I made a third modif at 11:32 and just repeat the commit and push commands - nothing was done
redo the "add" command is necessary apparently
